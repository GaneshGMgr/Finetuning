    "## Overview\n",
    "This is a step-by-step outline of how Large Language Model (LLM) distillation is performed, using **BERT** as the teacher model and **DistilBERT** as the student model.\n",

    "| **0. Imports & Config** | Import all required Python libraries (Transformers, Torch, etc.), detect GPU/CPU, and set hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, epochs, temperature, alpha). |\n",
    "| **1. Dataset**          | Load a demo text dataset, tokenize it using the tokenizer; the data collator automatically pads sequences so each batch is uniform. |\n",
    "| **2. Models**           | Load pretrained **BERT** as the teacher (freeze parameters), and **DistilBERT** as the student (trainable).                         |\n",
    "| **3. Losses**           | Use two loss functions: <br>• **CrossEntropy (CE)** = for hard labels (ground truth) <br>• **KL Divergence** = for soft labels (teacher’s logits → softmax with temperature). |\n",
    "| **4. Optimizer**        | Use **AdamW** optimizer with a **linear learning rate scheduler** for smoother and more stable training.                            |\n",
    "| **5. distill_epoch()**  | For each batch: <br>• Get teacher logits and create soft targets with temperature <br>• Get student logits <br>• Compute soft loss and hard loss, combine them using α <br>• Backpropagate **only** through the student model. |\n",
    "| **evaluate()**          | Evaluate the student model’s accuracy on the validation set to monitor performance improvements.                                   |\n",
    "| **Loop**                | For each epoch: run `distill_epoch()` followed by `evaluate()`.                                                                     |\n",
